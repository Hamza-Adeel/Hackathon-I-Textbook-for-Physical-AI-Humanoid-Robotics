Create Specification 2 for Phase 2 of the project: “Vector Retrieval and Validation Testing”. Context: - Spec 1 (content ingestion and embedding) is completed successfully - Ingestion code is stored in the backend/ folder - All textbook content is already embedded and stored in Qdrant - No re-ingestion or re-embedding is allowed Objective: Validate that stored vectors can be retrieved accurately and meaningfully before integrating any LLMs or APIs. Requirements: - Connect to the existing Qdrant Cloud collection - Perform semantic search over embedded textbook content - Retrieve top-k relevant chunks for user queries - Inspect and validate retrieved text and metadata - Ensure results are grounded in textbook content - Identify irrelevant, duplicated, or weak chunks Constraints: - No FastAPI - No OpenAI Agents - No text generation - Retrieval and validation only - Backend scripts only Deliverables: - Retrieval module inside backend/retrieve - Retrieval logic and test queries - Validation checklist confirming readiness for LLM integration Output must be: - Clear and structured - Focused on correctness and data quality - Ready for hackathon execution
