# Fundamentals of Physics Simulation (Gravity, Collisions)

This lesson explores the core principles behind physics simulation in robotics, focusing on gravity and collision detection.

## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the importance of physics simulation in robotics development.
- Explain how gravity is modeled and applied in simulation environments.
- Describe the basics of collision detection and response.

## Main Content
- The role of physics engines in digital twin simulations.
- Modeling gravity: how simulators apply gravitational forces to rigid bodies.
- Collision detection algorithms: broad phase vs. narrow phase.
- Collision response: elastic vs. inelastic collisions, friction.
- Limitations and challenges of physics simulation accuracy.

## Tutorial/Example
A simple example using a basic physics engine (e.g., a short Python script with `pygame` or a conceptual demonstration in a simulator like Gazebo if a minimal example is feasible) to show how gravity affects a falling object and how two colliding objects interact. This tutorial will emphasize the configuration of physical properties (mass, inertia, friction) for accurate simulation.

## Summary
- Physics simulation is crucial for testing robot behavior in virtual environments.
- Gravity and collisions are fundamental phenomena that must be accurately modeled.
- Simulation accuracy depends on the physics engine, object properties, and environmental setup.
