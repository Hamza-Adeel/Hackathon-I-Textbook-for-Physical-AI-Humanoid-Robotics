# Setting up Environments in Gazebo and Unity

This lesson guides you through setting up simulation environments in Gazebo and Unity for digital twin development.

## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Gazebo for robotics simulation.
- Set up a Unity project for a digital twin, integrating with ROS 2.
- Create basic virtual environments in both simulators.

## Main Content
- Introduction to Gazebo: features, ROS 2 integration, GUI.
- Installing Gazebo and its ROS 2 packages.
- Creating a simple Gazebo world: adding ground planes, walls, and lights.
- Introduction to Unity for robotics: advantages, Unity Robotics Hub.
- Setting up a Unity project for ROS 2 communication (ROS-TCP-Connector).
- Building a basic scene in Unity: importing assets, defining colliders.

## Tutorial/Example
A step-by-step tutorial on:
1. Setting up a basic Gazebo world and launching it with a ROS 2 compatible robot model (e.g., the `turtlebot3`).
2. Creating a simple Unity scene, importing a robot model (e.g., from URDF), and establishing a connection to ROS 2 using the ROS-TCP-Connector.

## Summary
- Gazebo is a powerful open-source simulator widely used with ROS 2 for high-fidelity physics.
- Unity offers a visually rich and flexible environment for digital twins, especially for human-robot interaction and advanced visualization.
- Both simulators can be integrated with ROS 2 to create comprehensive digital twin systems.
