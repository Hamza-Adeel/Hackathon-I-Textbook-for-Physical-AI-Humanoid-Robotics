# Building ROS 2 Systems with Python (rclpy)

This lesson focuses on practical application of ROS 2 concepts using `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2.

## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of `rclpy` for ROS 2 development in Python.
- Create ROS 2 nodes, publishers, subscribers, and services using `rclpy`.
- Develop simple ROS 2 applications entirely in Python.

## Main Content
- Introduction to `rclpy` and its advantages for rapid prototyping.
- Setting up a Python environment for ROS 2.
- Creating a minimal publisher and subscriber node in Python.
- Implementing a simple service and client in Python.
- Using ROS 2 command-line tools to inspect `rclpy` nodes and communication.

## Tutorial/Example
A step-by-step tutorial guiding you through creating a Python ROS 2 package, defining a custom message type, implementing a publisher that sends these messages, and a subscriber that processes them. The example will involve simulating a robot's battery level and a monitor displaying it.

## Summary
- `rclpy` is the standard Python client library for ROS 2.
- It provides APIs to create and manage ROS 2 entities like nodes, topics, and services.
- Python is highly suitable for ROS 2 development due to its ease of use and extensive library ecosystem.
