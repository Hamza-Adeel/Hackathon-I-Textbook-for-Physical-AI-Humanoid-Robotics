Create a Constitution for a Docusaurus-based textbook titled
“Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics”.

Mission:
Create a complete, detailed, university-level textbook that teaches Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics from beginner to intermediate level, with clear explanations and practical depth.

Scope:
The book must cover four chapters:
1. ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System
2. Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity
3. AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac
4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Each chapter must contain detailed lessons, not summaries or overviews.

Content Rules:
- No short or overview-only explanations.
- Every lesson must explain concepts step by step.
- Include definitions, theory, and reasoning.
- Include practical examples and use cases.
- Include code snippets where relevant (ROS 2, URDF, simulation, navigation).
- Explain diagrams and system flows in text.
- Assume the reader is a beginner progressing to intermediate level.

Format:
- Use clear headings and subheadings.
- Follow a textbook style, not blog style.
- Maintain consistency across all chapters.

Tools:
- Docusaurus for publishing
- Markdown for content

Constraints:
- Do not change chapter structure once defined.
- Preserve folder structure.
- Prioritize clarity over brevity.

Deliverables:
- A fully written Docusaurus textbook with detailed chapters and lessons.
- Content suitable for academic teaching and self-study.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Each lesson contains multiple sections and substantial explanation.
- Readers can understand and implement concepts without external references.
- The book reads like a real robotics textbook, not documentation notes.
