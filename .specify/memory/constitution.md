# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

This document outlines the mission, principles, and governance for the project to create a Docusaurus textbook on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". Its purpose is to ensure clarity, alignment, and quality, with a strict focus on producing a beginner-friendly book.

## Core Principles

### I. Mission & Scope
Our mission is to create a comprehensive, beginner-friendly Docusaurus textbook on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
- **In Scope:**
  - A complete Docusaurus textbook covering the fundamentals of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
  - Writing and structuring content in Markdown.
  - Configuring the Docusaurus site for navigation and presentation.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Any interactive components beyond standard Docusaurus features (e.g., chatbots, APIs, databases).
  - Any technologies not explicitly listed in the approved stack.

### II. Roles & Responsibilities
To maintain clarity and accountability, roles are defined as follows:
- **Architect:** Designs the book's overall structure, learning path, and chapter outline.
- **Author:** Writes the content, creates examples, and ensures technical accuracy and clarity.

### III. Technology Stack & Tools
The project MUST adhere to the following approved technology stack to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- **Content:** Markdown
- **Platform:** Docusaurus

### IV. Constraints & Guardrails
Simplicity and accessibility are core constraints.
- **Beginner-Focused:** All content MUST be written for a beginner audience. Explanations should be clear and avoid unnecessary jargon.
- **Focus on Writing:** All effort should be directed towards content creation and structuring the book. Do not add complex features or customizations to the Docusaurus site.

### V. Final Deliverables
The project's success is measured by the delivery of one primary output:
- **Docusaurus Textbook:** A publicly accessible website with the complete textbook content, well-organized and easy to navigate.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project rules and principles. Any proposed changes must be reviewed and approved by the project architect. All development activities must align with these principles.
