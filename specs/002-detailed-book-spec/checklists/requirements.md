# Specification Quality Checklist: Detailed Robotics Textbook Content

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (specifies *what* topics to cover, not *how* to write the prose).
- [X] Focused on user value (a structured learning path) and business needs (a complete textbook).
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders (the structure and goals are clear).
- [X] All mandatory sections completed.

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
- [X] Requirements are testable (e.g., "MUST be structured into 4 chapters").
- [X] Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "80% of users find the content clear").
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not Docusaurus internals).
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined for the primary user stories.
- [X] Edge cases are implicitly handled by the comprehensive chapter outline.
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded by the 4 chapters.
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions are clear (e.g., assumes Docusaurus platform).

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (the topics themselves are the criteria).
- [X] User scenarios cover the primary learning flows through the book.
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria.
- [X] No implementation details leak into the specification.

## Notes

- The specification is highly detailed and provides a clear roadmap for content creation. All checks pass. The project is ready for the planning phase.
